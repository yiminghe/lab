      <h1>Flanking Menus</h1>
      <p>
        With the popularity of three column layouts, this layout is bound to be
        useful to many. You may have seen this technique used at
        <a href="http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/" title="wrongwaygoback"
          >dynamic ribbon device</a
        >. In fact, this "flanking menus" technique was devised by BlueRobot for
        that site. Surprisingly, the technique has caused quite a bit of talk.
        The concept is simple: a content box with large margins is flanked by
        two additional (menu) boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important benefit of this technique is the order of elements in the
        HTML source. Here, the order is essentially content, menu one, menu two.
        For old browsers, text-only browsers, screen-readers, and many
        alternative devices, this means that the content is displayed before the
        menus. And, after all, most users visit a page for its content.

      <h2>Known Issues</h2>
      <p>
        This layout fails in IE4.5/Mac. That browser has poor support for CSS
        absolute positioning, yet it recognizes and executes the CSS @import
        statement used to hide CSS from broken browsers. Currently, there is no
        known solution.

      <h2>A Call To Action</h2>
      <p>
        Much effort has been made to ensure that the layouts in the BlueRobot
        Layout Reservoir appear as intended in CSS2 compliant browsers. The
        content should be viewable, though unstyled, in other web browsers. If
        you encounter a problem that is not listed as a known issue, I am most
        likely not aware of it. <em>Please</em>
        <a
          href="mailto:rob@bluerobot.com?subject=Layout Reservoir"
          title="Email BlueRobot about a layout issue"
          >email me</a
        >
        a heads-up. Your help will benefit the other five or six people who
        visit this site.
