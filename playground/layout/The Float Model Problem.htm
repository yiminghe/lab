      <h2>Float model? What's that?</h2>
      <p>
        Okay, here is a simple test concerning how static elements interact with
        floats. According to the W3C specifications, when a floated element is
        directly followed by a static element (one that is normally flowed),
        then first, the float will be displayed against the left edge of the
        containing element (in this case the 'body' element), and then the
        static element will also display against that same edge, and at the same
        vertical height as the float.
      </p>
      <p>
        The float should overlay the static element, unless the static element
        has a left margin that moves it out to the right, and out from behind
        the float. The static element might also be 'cleared' (clear:left or
        clear:both), which would put it below the level of the float.
      </p>
      <h2>Details of the test</h2>
      <p>
        The green bordered box (div#left) is floated left in the 'body', and is
        followed by div#static (purple box). If div#static had no width, then
        all modern browsers would display correctly, with the purple box
        overlaid by the green bordered box.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, because div#static is <span>width defined</span>, browser variance
        is fully evident. That 'width' declaration makes
        <span>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</span> put div#static alongside the float
        as tho the float were part of the left body edge.
        <span>Moz/N7</span> and <span>Op6/7.1</span> do it according to the
        specs, with both boxes firmly pinned to the left body edge.
      </p>
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        Making sophisticated use of float layouts sometimes requires stating the
        'widths' on some boxes, but doing so to a static box that follows a
        float makes IE display differently than any browser that dares to adhere
        to the standards. So differently in fact, as to make the situation
        impossible to ignore. (unless one happens to be
        *you&nbsp;know&nbsp;who*)
      </p>
      <p>
        So the choice is to code only for IE, knowing the minority browsers will
        break, or avoid using the 'width' declaration in many cases, putting
        many types of layouts 'off&nbsp;limits'. Some choice.
      </p>
      <h2>IE6 is not IE5.5</h2>
      <p>
        The demo you see here is fully pixel defined, but usually a layout has
        the widths in percentages, at least for the elements following the
        float. When div#static is given a percentage width, IE5.5 looks at the
        available horizontal space alongside the float and says "That is now
        defined as 100% of the width". So if div#static gets 'width: 50%;', that
        div is half as wide as the space next to the float and starts next to
        the float as mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, IE6 is different. Yes IE6 does start the div next to the float,
        but it does <em>not</em> take the float into consideration when figuring
        the width of div#static. Rather it uses the entire container as the 100%
        width refrence, just as the specs require. Yet it <em>does</em> start
        the div alongside the float! So the problem is only half-fixed in IE6,
        creating one more headache for us poor coders.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this mean? Well, if the div is given a width of 100%, it is as
        wide as the body element, and being placed next to the float it forces
        the right edge of the body element sideways by the width of the float,
        causing a scrollbar. <em>But only in IE6!</em> As if this mess weren't
        already bad enough. Oy.
      </p>
      <h2>Close call in Norway</h2>
      <p>
        There was recently a disturbing turn of events. <span>Opera7</span>,
        (released Jan-2003) was doing just what IE does; putting div#static next
        to the float, rather than having div#static ignore the float and start
        at the left viewport edge, as was done in Op6.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seemed to be a 'cave-in' on the part of the Opera decision makers,
        to take the 'easy path', rather than stick to the specifications.
        Microsoft is indeed very influential, and apparently the float
        specifications were fast becoming a dead letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happily Opera 7.1 (released April-2003) properly obeys the float
        specification. Whew!
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Last thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I am no purist, and could happily live with a specification designed by
        Microsoft, but to have MS publicly support the specs while silently
        flouting them really burns my toast. Is this how the future is made?
      </p>
      <p>
        It's past time that these issues were aired out. Gentle reader, if you
        know any way of 'getting to' the movers and shakers at Microsoft, won't
        you please try and shake loose some kind of information regarding future
        plans? I dread having to tell the next newbie that the simple,
        straightfoward CSS standards can't simply be used 'as is', because the
        majority browser maker refuses to conform as it supposedly has agreed to
        do. This situation has got to end sometime; why can't it be now?
      </p>
